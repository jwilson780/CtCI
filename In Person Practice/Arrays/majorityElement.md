*There are several methods to this, I included one in the java files*

Write a function which takes an array and prints the majority element (if it exists), otherwise prints “No Majority Element”. A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element). 

## Example

	Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4}
	Output : 4 

	Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4}
	Output : No Majority Element
