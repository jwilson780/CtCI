*There are several methods to this, one is king.*

You are given an array of n+2 elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to n. And all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers. 

## Example

    array = {4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1} and n = 5

	The above array has n + 2 = 7 elements with all elements 	
	occurring once except 2 and 4 which occur twice. So the output 		
	should be 4 2.
